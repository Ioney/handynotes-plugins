* Add custom icon support for POIs (caves, etc)
* Sub-tooltips on hover to inspect items, spells and rewards
* Add list of map items to quest log panel (new tab?)
* Investigate auto NPC coloring for tooltips (red, green, yellow).

* Is the Anniversary Event even relevant for Classic?

## Burning Crusade
