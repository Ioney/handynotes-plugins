# Things to do

## General

* Add mouse-over labels and context menu waypoints for POI dots
* Add custom icon support for POIs (caves, etc)
* Sub-tooltips on hover to inspect items, spells and rewards
* Add list of map items to quest log panel (new tab?)
* Investigate auto NPC coloring for tooltips (red, green, yellow).

## Classic

* There is so little content, maybe merge to Cataclysm or WotLK?
* Is the Anniversary Event even relevant for Classic?

## Burning Crusade

* review all Data

## Wrath of the Lich King

* review all Data

## Cataclysm

* review all Data, lots of quest IDs have changed.
